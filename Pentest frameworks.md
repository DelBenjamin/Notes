# Framework for pentesting


## 1. OSSTMM (stands for Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual, or OSSTMM, is a peer-reviewed methodology for security testing, maintained by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM). OSSTMM's goal is to provide a scientific process for the accurate characterization of operation security that can be used for 
penetration testing, ethical hacking, and other security testing.

### a. 5 testing channels and methodology :

	I. Human Security: The security of human interaction and communication is evaluated operationally as a means of testing
	
	II. Physical Security: The OSSTMM tests physical security defined as any tangible element of security that takes physical
	effort to operate
	
	III. Wireless Communications: Electronic communications, signals, and emanations are all considered wireless 
	communications that are part of the operational security testing
	
	IV. Telecommunications: Whether the telecommunication network is digital or analog, any communication conducted 
	over telephone or network lines are tested in the OSSTMM
	
	V. Data Networks: The security testing of data networks includes electronic systems and data networks that are used 
	for communication or interaction via cable and wired network lines

## 2. NIST SP 800-115 (stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology)

It provides a relatively high-level overview for designing, implementing and maintaining technical information security test and examination processes and procedures. It is aimed at supporting organisations in planning and executing tests in finding vulnerabilities in a system or network and verifying compliance with a policy or other requirements.

## 3. PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standards)

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard, or PTES, is a standard that was developed and continues to be enhanced by a group of information security experts from various industries. PTES provides a minimum baseline for what is required of a penetration test, expanding from initial communication between client and tester to what a report includes.

The goal of PTES is to provide quality guidance that helps raise the bar of quality for penetration testing. The standardization of penetration testing procedures helps organizations better understand the services they are paying for and gives penetration testers accurate direction on what to do during a penetration test.

### a. PTES Process : 

	I. Pre-engagement Interactions:
	This is the preparation phase for the pen test. It is all about document approvals and tools needed for the test.
	
	II. Intelligence gathering:
	In this phase information about the target system are gathered from external sources like social media websites, official
	records etc. This phase comes under OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence).
	
	III. Threat Modelling:
	It is a procedure for optimizing network security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining 
	countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system. It is skipped in typical pan tests.
	
	IV. Vulnerability Analysis:
	This phase discovers and validates vulnerabilities.That is risk that an attacker could exploit and gain authorized
	access to the system or application.
	
	V. Exploitation:
	In this phase, the tester try to reach the security of the target system using the vulnerabilities previously 
	identified and validated.
	
	VI. Post Exploitation:
	This phase maintains the control over target system and collects data.
	
	VII. Reporting:
	Documents entire process in a form understandable to the client. The report about the security of the target system.

## 4. OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

APPLICATION DOMAIN : WEB APPLICATION

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an online community that produces freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies in the field of web application security.

## 6. ISSAF (Information System Security Assessment Framework)

It's a methodology supported by Open Information Systems Security Group (OISSG) Although it is no longer maintained and, therefore, a bit out of date, one of its strengths is that it links individual pentest steps with pentesting tools. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide in conducting a pentest and can be a good basis for developing your own custom methodology.

ISSAF breaks the pentesting project into three phases: 
- Planning and preparation
- Assessment
- Reporting, clean-up and destroy artefacts
