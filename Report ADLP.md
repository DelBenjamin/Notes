# ADLP Report

Website : https://adlp-corp.com/

Objectives : find 9 flags (not same syntax for them) and write a small report of how you did it.

## Flag n°1

First of all, I inspected the source code of their website. I copied and paste it in a VS Code sheet and read it. On line 534, I noticed a comment on a future feature the website wanted to add : 

  "		<!--	Contact us
	*********************************  
	// TO DO : A secure contact form to prevent code injections.
	Good Job :  ADLP{HTML_COMMENT_FL4G_G456688}-->"
  


## Flag n°2

With the devTools in Chrome I kept investigating the different files of the website. I found something in style.css on line 45 : 

/* ADLP{CSS_HSBUSGYIG569816}*/

It might be another Flag.

## Flag n°3

## Flag n°4
